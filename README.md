This project is a basic image encryption tool that secures images using pixel manipulation techniques. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by applying transformations such as pixel value modifications or swaps.

ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ… Encrypts images using pixel-based transformations
âœ… Decrypts encrypted images back to their original form
âœ… Supports common image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, etc.)
âœ… Simple and lightweight implementation

ðŸ”¹ How It Works
Encryption: The tool alters pixel values using mathematical operations (e.g., XOR, addition, shifting) or swaps pixels in a structured manner.
Decryption: The same transformation is reversed to restore the original image.
ðŸ”¹ Ideal For
ðŸ”¸ Learning basic image encryption techniques
ðŸ”¸ Exploring how cryptography applies to digital media
ðŸ”¸ Experimenting with custom encryption logic
